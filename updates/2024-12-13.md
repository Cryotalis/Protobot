# #testing-facility Now Open (December 13th, 2024)
#testing-facility is now open to anyone who has the **DD2** role. It was previously limited to a select group of contributors, but I am opening it up to allow for more feedback on things I'm working on. The channel can get quite spammy when I'm testing commands, so feel free to mute the channel or remove it from your channel list through <id:browse> if you don't want to see it. Anyone can type in the channel, so you can test commands in there as well if you'd like.
