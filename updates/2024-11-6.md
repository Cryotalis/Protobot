# New Host for Protobot (November 6th, 2024)
Because of how much Protobot has grown (it's now used in over 400 servers!), my current cloud host no longer provides enough memory for Protobot to run. Protobot frequently crashes due to exceeding the memory limit and it's caused Protobot to sometimes have prolonged downtimes. I can restart the bot very easily, but people are usually really slow to let me know that it's gone down. I could increase the memory, but I'd have to pay for that, and I don't earn any money from developing and maintaining Protobot.

It's been this way for quite some time actually, but I just haven't done anything about it until now. Going forwards, I'll be hosting Protobot from the same place Europa bot is being hosted - an old laptop at home. If any issues arise as a result of this setup, I'll think about other options
