# Protobot Website Has Been Updated (July 14th, 2025)
### Home
- Images have been restored or upgraded into "gifs" (they're really mp4s) to better demonstrate Protobot's features.
  - I will create a "gif" for the `/defense` command when I resolve the issues it's currently having...
### Commands
- No change to this page, but I intend to hopefully find time in the future to provide proper documentation for the commands. Maybe I could implement something like a wiki.
### News
- Updates posted to this channel will now appear on the news page.
- In the future, I want to have Protobot automatically upload the updates I post here to the website. (Although, this may not really even be worth it given that I don't see myself pushing updates to Protobot too often currently).
### About
- Contributor cards have been visually updated so that they're more uniform in size.
- The "About Protobot" section has been completely rewritten.
### Open Source
- Protobot's GitHub repository has now been added to the navigation bar. I open sourced Protobot right at the end of 2022, it's about time I actually link its source code on the website.
### Misc
- Icons have been added to the navigation bar
- The contact button now brings up a pop-up box that provides 3 ways to contact me (this server, Reddit, Twitter) instead of just jumping to the bottom of the page.
