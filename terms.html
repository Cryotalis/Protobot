      <p>I don't collect any data other than what is necessary, and of course, I don't sell your data. Here are all the details regarding data collection:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Protobot's database is a <a class="has-text-link" target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yOjZhkn9z8dJ8HMD0YSUl7Ijgd9o1KJ62Ecf4SgyTdU" target="_blank" style="color:cornflowerblue">public Google Spreadsheet</a>. Anyone may view and make use of the information in the database.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your ID, username, and message content are logged whenever you make a post in one of the looking-for-trade channels in the official Dungeon Defenders Discord server, this information is used by the custom slowmode/automod feature of the looking-for-trade channels.
        </li>
        <li>
          When someone uses a command, Protobot logs what command it was and who used it, as well as the server name and server ID of the server it was used in. This is for debugging purposes. Here's an example of what that looks like:
