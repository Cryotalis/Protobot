      <p class="has-text-light">I don't collect any data other than what is necessary, and of course, I don't sell your data. Here are all the details regarding data collection:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Protobot's database is a <a class="has-text-link" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yOjZhkn9z8dJ8HMD0YSUl7Ijgd9o1KJ62Ecf4SgyTdU/edit#gid=398831537" target="_blank" style="color:cornflowerblue">public Google Spreadsheet</a>. Anyone may view and make use of the information in the database.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your ID, Tag, and message content are logged whenever you make a post in one of the looking-for-trade channels in the official Dungeon Defenders Discord server, this information is used by the custom slowmode/automod feature of the looking-for-trade channels.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is a suspicious links automod active in the Official Dungeon Defenders server, Juicy Nation, and the Cryo Chamber. It logs message content whenever someone posts a suspicious link.
        </li>
        <li>
          When someone uses a command, Protobot logs what command it was, when it was used, and the guild (server) name and guild ID of the guild it was used in. This is for debugging purposes. Here's an example of what that looks like:
