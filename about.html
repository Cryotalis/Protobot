    <p class="has-text-white-ter">
      Protobot is the first Discord bot I created, and this was my first real step into the world of programming. I taught myself NodeJS and started working on this project in 2019. At the time, the popular <a class="has-text-link" target="_blank" href="https://dd2tools.com">DD2Tools</a> website had just been retired along with the DD2Tools Discord bot. The developer behind these tools, <a class="has-text-link" target="_blank" href="https://wiki.dungeondefenders2.com/wiki/User:Czokalapik">Czokalapik</a>, cited a lack of funding and interest in the game. I wanted to create a replacement for the DD2Tools Discord bot, so I started this project. Mr. Juicebags was kind enough to allow the bot into his Discord server when I first started development so I could receive valuable feedback from his community.

      I was quickly able to recreate DD2Tools' most prominent feature â€” the shard search command. I then introduced several new functionalities such as mod search, minimum ascension calculation, and drakenfrost rotation status. Shortly afterwards, I convinced the Admin of the official Dungeon Defenders Discord server at the time, Kaoe, to add Protobot to the server. Protobot was kept exclusive to the DD Discord server for a number of years due to Kaoe's influence, but I've since made Protobot available to everyone.
      
      <!-- In hindsight, I think this was a mistake. By reaching out to him instead of vice versa, I believe I gave him too much influence over the bot's development and allowed him to keep Protobot exclusive to the DD server for a number of years. Protobot would have inevitably been added to the official DD server anyway due to its already growing popularity, and keeping it exclusive to the server greatly stifled its growth. I will add though that Kaoe still provided great feedback and I believe his involvement was still a net positive. -->

    <p class="has-text-white-ter">
      Today, Protobot is in use in over 500 Discord servers. It is <a class="has-text-link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Cryotalis/Protobot-TS">open source</a> and uses a publicly available <a class="has-text-link" target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yOjZhkn9z8dJ8HMD0YSUl7Ijgd9o1KJ62Ecf4SgyTdU">Google spreadsheet</a> as its primary database. I am now the sole Administrator of the official Dungeon Defenders Discord server, and Protobot serves a few special functions in the DD server. An exclusive blue Protobot pet has also since been added to DD2. I gave them out to those who made major contributions to Protobot and/or the community.
