    <p class="has-text-light">
      I became interested in learning how to create my own Discord bot near the end of 2018. At the time, all I wanted to do was create a “mock” command, which would take some text and randomly capitalize the letters, emulating the mocking spongebob meme. After my first attempt failed, I gave up, but returned to the project 3 months later, this time succeeding. After this, I sought to replace the dd2tools bot, which had been retired just a month prior due to a lack of funding and interest from its creator. To do this, I created the first version of <a class="has-text-link" href="https://github.com/Cryotalis/Protobot-Old">Protobot</a>, written with NodeJS & Discord.js in Javascript.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="has-text-light">
      The primary feature of the dd2tools bot was its ability to pull up Shard information. To recreate this, I connected Protobot to a google spreadsheet I already compiled which contained a list of all Shards and Mods, and took some time to set up fuzzy matching to make sure that even when people misspelled a Shard, Protobot would still fetch the correct one. I started development of Protobot on Juicebags’s server, and within a week, developed several other commands in addition to shard and mod - minasc, drakenfrost, mastery, link, news, and a help command. Just a few days later, it would be added to the official Dungeon Defenders server.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="has-text-light">
      Protobot would go on to gain several new commands and lose old ones. After leaving the project for a couple of months, the bot fell into disrepair (in 2021) as it was not updated to the latest version of Discord.js. It would go down for about 2 months, after which I rewrote <a class="has-text-link" href="https://github.com/Cryotalis/Protobot-Python">Protobot in Python</a> with Discord.py instead to learn the language. Just a few months after this, the creator of Discord.py would announce that the library was being put on maintenance mode, at which point I rewrote Protobot again, returning to my roots and this time writing it in TypeScript with Discord.js. This is the version of Protobot that is in use today.
